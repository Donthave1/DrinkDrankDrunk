### A prototype of our dataset object :
	
```{  
<--Expected to be on our first data sets-->  
wineName:  
	wineType:  
	year:  
	vineyard:  
	price:  
	professionalReview:  
<--Following Data may need a more scraping-->  
	consumerReview:  
	recommendFoodPairing:  
<--Things that we may consider to add→  
	taste: (acidity/dry/sweet etc.)  
	brandSummary:  
}  
```

## Contents

**Home Page (Ed)**  
	- Form for the user to submit some criteria  
	- Make a selection based on Budget or Drunkenness Level or Food Paring?  

**Budget Selection (Pete)**  
- Price vs. Professional or Consumer Review scatter plot page.  
- Based on the main types of wine (Merlot, Cabernet Sauv, Pinot, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc)  
- Each dot is a brand  
- When user click on the brand dot, leads to the brand profile page(see below)  

**Drunkenness Level (Stef)**  
- Rank the wine type based on the average alcohol content (eg. Dangerous/wasted/tipsy/relax/ Grape Juice)  
- Based on the user’s selection, display a bar chart that shows the alcohol content per brand under that type.  
- Clicking on the brand name will lead to the profile page.  

**Food Pairing (Yo)**  
- Some options such as meat/ veggie/ soup/ salad/ pasta etc.  
- Select the food option and display a pie chart that will show percentage of each type of wine that pairs well with the food type. Selecting the type of wine will display all brands of that wine type that pairs well with the food.  

**Brand Profile (Ed)**  
- A conclusion page that tells you the taste of the wine, and probably a summary of the wine, where it is from etc.   
- Should also display the alcohol content, pricing, and food pairing so the user can get all information about the brand.
